Overview

Built Excel and Monte Carlo simulation models to optimize Starbucks’ sourcing and pricing strategy. The end goal was to maximize profit.

Key Features

1.	Simulates different sourcing strategies, demand curves, and open market price distributions.
2.	Models tiered pre-season contract pricing and demand-price correlations.
3.	Identifies optimal roast bean price and contract percentage to boost profit.

 What This Model Does
 
1.	Simulates Starbucks’ annual profit under different open market price distributions (triangular, discrete, historical, custom).
2.	Models demand uncertainty using normal distributions and explores the impact of correlations with raw material prices.
3.	Identifies optimal roast bean pricing and pre-season contracting percentages to maximize expected profit.
4.	Evaluates expansion into new markets with distinct demand curves and fixed costs.

Tools

1.	Microsoft Excel with data tables, solver, and randomization for simulations.
2.	Excel charts for visualization.

 Results
 
1.	Suggested strategy changes projected to increase expected profit by 21%.
2.	Provided clear visuals (histograms, scatter plots) for decision support.
